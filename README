Functionality

This plugin is based on a discussion in comp.editors (see the thread at
http://groups.google.com/group/comp.editors/browse_frm/thread/0f562d97f80dde13)

Narrowing means focussing on a region and making the rest inaccessible. You
simply select the region, call :NarrowRegion and the selected part will open
in a new scratch buffer. The rest of the file will be protected, so you won't
accidentally modify that buffer. In the new buffer, you can do a global
replace, search or anything else to modify that part. When you are finished,
simply write that buffer (e.g. by |:w|) and your modifications will be put in
the original buffer making it accessible again.

NrrwRgn allows you to either select a line based selection using an Ex-command
or you can simply use any visual selected region and press your prefered key
combination to open that selection in a new buffer.

                                                        *:NarrowRegion* *:NR*
:[range]NarrowRegion        When [range] is omited, select only the current
                            line, else use the lines in the range given and 
                            open it in a new Scratch Window. 
                            Whenever you are finished modifying that region
                            simply write the buffer.

:[range]NR                  This is a shortcut for :NarrowRegion

                                                        *:NarrowWindow* *:NW*
:NarrowWindow               Select only the range that is visible the current
                            window and open it in a new Scratch Window. 
                            Whenever you are finished modifying that region
                            simply write the buffer.

:NW                         This is a shortcut for :NarrowWindow

                                                                *:WidenRegion*
:WidenRegion[!]             This command is only available in the narrowed 
                            scratch window. If the buffer has been modified,
                            the contents will be put back on the original
                            buffer. If ! is specified, the window will be
                            closed, otherwise it will remain open.

                                                                        *:NRV*
:NRV                        Opened the narrowed window for the region that was
                            last selected in visual mode

                                                                        *:NUD*

:NUD                        When viewing unified diffs, this command opens the
                            current chunk in 2 Narrowed Windows in |diff-mode|
                            The current chunk is determined as the one, that
                            the cursor is at.
                            This command does not make sense if editing a
                            different file format (or even different diff format)

You can also start visual mode and have the selected region being narrowed. In
this mode, NarrowRegion allows you to block select |CTRL-V| , character select
|v| or linewise select |V| a region. Then press <Leader>nr where <Leader> by
default is set to '\', unless you have set it to something different (see
|<Leader>| for information how to change this) and the selected range will
open in a new scratch buffer. This key combination only works in |Visual-mode|

When finished, simply write that Narrowed Region window, from which you want
to take the modifications in your original file.

It is possible, to recursively open a Narrowed Window on top of an already
narrowed window. This sounds a little bit silly, but this makes it possible,
to have several narrowed windows, which you can use for several different
things, e.g. If you have 2 different buffers opened and you want to diff a
certain region of each of those 2 buffers, simply open a Narrowed Window for
each buffer, and execute |:diffthis| in each narrowed window.

You can then interactively merge those 2 windows. And when you are finished,
simply write the narrowed window and the changes will be taken back into the
original buffer.

When viewing unified diffs, you can use the provided |:NUD| command to open 2
Narrowed Windows side by side viewing the current chunk in |diff-mode|. Those
2 Narrowed windows will be marked 'modified', since there was some post
processing involved when opening the narrowed windows. Be careful, when
quitting the windows, not to write unwanted changes into your patch file! In
the window that contains the unified buffer, you can move to a different
chunk, run :NUD and the 2 Narrowed Windows in diff mode will update.

==============================================================================
2.1 NrrwRgn Configuration                                    *NrrwRgn-config*

NarrowRegion can be customized by setting some global variables. If you'd
like to open the narrowed windo as a vertical split buffer, simply set the
variable g:nrrw_rgn_vert to 1 in your |.vimrc| >

    let g:nrrw_rgn_vert = 1
<
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you'd like to specify a certain width/height for you scratch buffer, then
set the variable g:nrrw_rgn_wdth in your |.vimrc| . This variable defines the
width or the nr of columns, if you have also set g:nrrw_rgn_vert. >

    let g:nrrw_rgn_wdth = 30
<
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default, NarrowRegion highlights the region that has been selected
using the WildMenu highlighting (see |hl-WildMenu|). If you'd like to use a
different highlighting, set the variable g:nrrw_rgn_hl to your preferred
highlighting Group. For example to have the region highlighted like a search
result, you could put that in your |.vimrc| >

    let g:nrrw_rgn_hl = 'Search'
<
If you want to turn off the highlighting (because this can be disturbing, you
can set the global variable g:nrrw_rgn_nohl to 1 in your |.vimrc| >

    let g:nrrw_rgn_nohl = 1
<
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you'd like to change the key combination, that starts the Narrowed Window
for you selected range, you could put this in your |.vimrc| >

   xmap <F3> <Plug>NrrwrgnDo
<
This will let <F3> open the Narrow-Window, but only if you have pressed it in
Visual Mode. It doesn't really make sense to map this combination to any other
mode, unless you want it to Narrow your last visually selected range.

4. NrrwRgn History                                          *NrrwRgn-history*

0.17: November, 23, 2010
- cache the options, that will be set (instead of parsing
  $VIMRUNTIME/doc/options.txt everytime) in the Narrowed Window
- getting the options didn't work, when using an autocommand like this:
  autocmd BufEnter * cd %:p:h
  (reported by Xu Hong, Thanks!)
- :q didn't clean up the Narrowed Buffer correctly. Fix this
- some code cleanup

0.16: November, 16, 2010
- Bugfix: copy all local options to the narrowed window (reported by Xu Hong,
  Thanks!)

0.15: August, 26, 2010
- Bugfix: minor documentation update (reported by Hong Xu, Thanks!)

0.14: August, 26, 2010
- Bugfix: :only in the original buffer resulted in errors (reported by Adam
  Monsen, Thanks!)

0.13: August, 22, 2010
- Unified Diff Handling (experimental feature)

0.12: July 29, 2010

- Version 0.11, wasn't packaged correctly and the vimball file
  contained some garbage. (Thanks Dennis Hostetler!)

0.11: July 28, 2010

- Don't set 'winfixwidth' and 'winfixheight' (suggested by Charles Campbell)

0.10: May 20,2010

- Restore Cursorposition using winrestview() and winsaveview()
- fix a bug, that prevented the use of visual narrowing
- Make sure when closing the narrowed buffer, the content will be written to
  the right original region
- use topleft for opening the Narrowed window
- check, that the original buffer is still available
- If you Narrow the complete buffer using :NRV and write the changes back, an
  additional trailing line is inserted. Remove that line.
- When writing the changes back, update the highlighting.

0.9: May 20, 2010

- It is now possible to Narrow a window recursively. This allows to have
  several narrowed windows, and allows for example to only diff certain
  regions (as was suggested in a recent thread at the vim_use mailinglist:
  http://groups.google.com/group/vim_use/msg/05d7fd9bd1556f0e) therefore, the
  use for the g:nrrw_rgn_sepwin variable isn't necessary anymore.
- Small documentation updates

0.8: May 18, 2010

- the g:nrrw_rgn_sepwin variable can be used to force seperate Narrowed
  Windows, so you could easily diff those windows.
- make the separating of several windows a little bit safer (look at the
  bufnr(), so it should work without problems for several buffers)
- switch from script local variables to buffer local variables, so narrowing
  for several buffers should work.
- set 'winfixheight' for narrowed window 
- Added command :NRV (suggested by Charles Campbell, thanks!)
- added error handling, in case :NRV is called, without a selected region
- take care of beeps, when calling :NRV
- output WarningMsg

0.7: May 17, 2010

- really use the black hole register for deleting the old buffer contents in
  the narrowed buffer (suggestion by esquifit in
  http://groups.google.com/group/comp.editors/msg/3eb3e3a7c68597db)
- make autocommand nesting, so the highlighting will be removed when writing
  the buffer contents.
- Use g:nrrw_rgn_nohl variable to disable highlighting (as this can be
  disturbing).

0.6: May 04, 2010

- the previous version had problems restoring the orig buffer, this version
  fixes it (highlighting and setl ma did not work correctly)

0.5: May 04, 2010       

- The mapping that allows for narrowing a visually selected range, did not
  work.  (Fixed!)
- Make :WidenRegion work as expected (close the widened window) (unreleased)

0.4: Apr 28, 2010       

- Highlight narrowed region in the original buffer
- Save and Restore search-register
- Provide shortcut commands |:NR| 
- Provide command |:NW| and |:NarrowWindow|
- Make plugin autoloadable
- Enable GLVS (see |:GLVS|)
- Provide Documenation (:h NarrowRegion)
- Distribute Plugin as vimball |pi_vimball.txt|

0.3: Apr 28, 2010       

- Initial upload
- development versions are available at the github repository
- put plugin on a public repository (http://github.com/chrisbra/NrrwRgn)
