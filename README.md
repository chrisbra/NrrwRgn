#NrrwRgn plugin
> A Vim plugin for focussing on a selected region

This plugin is inspired by the [Narrowing feature of Emacs](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Narrowing) and means to focus on a selected region while making the rest inaccessible. You simply select the region, call `:NR` and the selected part will open in a new split window while the rest of the buffer will be protected. Once you are finished, simply write the narrowed window (`:w`) and all the changes will be moved back to the original buffer.

See also the following screencast, that shows several features available:

###Installation
Use the plugin manager of your choice. Or download the [stable][] version of the plugin, edit it with Vim (`vim NrrwRgn-XXX.vmb`) and simply source it (`:so %`). Restart and take a look at the help (`:h NrrwRgn.txt`)
